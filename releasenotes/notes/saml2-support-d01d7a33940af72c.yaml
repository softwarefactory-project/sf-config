features:
  - SAML2 support
    Software Factory can be configured as a Service Provider
    to a SAML2-enabled Identity Provider.
issues:
  - The SAML session is discarded immediately after the
    authentication is successful, the session is still
    handled by auth_pubtkt in cauth. This means that
    terminating a user's session on the Identity Provider
    will not terminate it on Software Factory. The
    administrator should configure Software Factory's cookie
    timeout to match the Identity Provider's own session timeout.
upgrade:
  - There is a new subsection in the 'authentication' section
    of sfconfig.yaml, called 'SAML2'. The administrator must
    input mapping values with relevant data as provided by
    the Identity Provider.
