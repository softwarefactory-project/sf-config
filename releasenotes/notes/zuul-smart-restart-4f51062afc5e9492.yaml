features:

    sfconfig won't restart zuul services if jobs are running, it will wait up
    to 10 minutes before giving up and sending a mail to an adminstrator to
    request a manual restart. This prevent loosing pipeline queues when changing
    operator setting such as zuul_log_level or when adding an external gerrit.
fixes:
  - |
    The zuul-launcher service is no longer hard restarted, instead a graceful
    command is performed before to prevent leaking nodepool attached instance.
