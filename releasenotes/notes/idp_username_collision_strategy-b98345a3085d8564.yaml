features:
  - Add a "differentiate-users" option to sfconfig.yaml, allowing an operator
    to specify the strategy for handling usernames collisions when more than
    one identity provider is specified. The default behavior is to reject
    any user whose username was already registered to a different IdP.
    Activating the option will differentiate usernames with a hash, allowing
    users to log in as distinct entities.
    Note that it is not advisable to use more than one external IdP.
