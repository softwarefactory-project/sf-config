See: https://softwarefactory-project.io/cgit/software-factory/sf-config/tree/sfconfig/inventory.py#n377\n\nThere is no setting (yet) to differentiate backup that needs to be restore before or after a service is deployed. Thus I think we need to:\n\n  * In the restore phase, move the backup.ndjson file to /etc/kibana\n  * At the end of the setup phase, check if the ndjson file exists\n  * If it does, run the kibana-backup restore command, and remove the file.",
